This folder contains simulation results and plots for a Low Pass Filter (LPF) analyzed over different input frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 10 kHz.
The designed LPF has a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz.

Objective

To analyze how the LPF attenuates signals beyond its cutoff frequency and verify its frequency response characteristics.

Details

1. Filter type: Passive RC Low Pass Filter
2. Cutoff Frequency (fc): 1 kHz
3. Frequency range tested: 100 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 5 kHz, 10 kHz

Observations:

1. At lower frequencies (< 1 kHz), output ≈ input (minimal attenuation).
2. Around 1 kHz, output starts to drop (−3 dB point).
3. Beyond 1 kHz, higher frequency components are significantly attenuated.
4. Included Plots
5. Input vs. Output waveforms for each test frequency
6. Magnitude response (Gain vs. Frequency)
7. Phase response (optional, if you’ve plotted it)

Conclusion
The observed results confirm that the LPF effectively allows low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating signals above the 1 kHz cutoff, consistent with theoretical expectations.
